# Data.gov Analysis
In this example, I decided to analyse what kind of datasets are available on data.gov, the formats, views, downloads etc instead of just focusing on 1 dataset. Had a lot of fun building this. 

## Dataset:
- I didn't use any specific dataset but rather did an analysis on the different datasets available on data.gov

## Run & Deploy
- First install all dependancies from the `pyproject.toml`.
- Run `preswald run` to make sure it doesn't have any issues.
- Deploy with `preswald deploy`!
