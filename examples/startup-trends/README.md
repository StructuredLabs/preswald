# Startup Data Analysis Dashboard

## Deployment
[The example project is deployed here on Structured Cloud](https://startup-data-analysis-768210-zlntbzje-ndjz2ws6la-ue.a.run.app/)


## Dataset

This project uses the [Startup Growth and Funding Trends](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samayashar/startup-growth-and-funding-trends) dataset from Kaggle. The dataset contains information about various startups including:

- Funding information (rounds, amounts, valuation)
- Industry classification
- Revenue and profitability metrics
- Employee count
- Market share percentage
- Year founded
- Geographical region
- Exit status

This rich dataset allows for comprehensive analysis of startup trends across different industries, regions, and time periods.

## Overview

This is an interactive dashboard built with Preswald that allows users to:

- View summary statistics of the startup ecosystem
- Filter startups based on various criteria
- Compare profitable vs non-profitable startups
- Visualize funding trends, industry distribution, and regional comparisons
- Analyze relationships between funding, valuation, and other metrics
