# EV Analytics Dashboard

## Dataset Source
The dataset used for this project is sourced from [Electric Vehicle Population Data](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/electric-vehicle-population-data). This dataset contains information on electric vehicles registered in the United States, including their make, model, electric range, and location.

## About the App
The EV Analytics Dashboard provides insights into electric vehicle registrations, distribution, and trends in the United States. The app offers interactive visualizations, including:
- A histogram of EV registrations over time.
- A pie chart showing the distribution of EV types.
- A bar chart of popular EV manufacturers.

- A map visualizing EV locations in the USA.

Users can filter the data using a slider to select a minimum electric range, refining the displayed insights.
