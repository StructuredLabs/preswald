# Preswald Project

## The dataset source:
Dataset Source

The dataset used in this project is the Iris dataset, which is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning and statistics. It consists of 150 samples of iris flowers categorized into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Each sample includes measurements of:

Sepal Length (cm)

Sepal Width (cm)

Petal Length (cm)

Petal Width (cm)

Species (the flower category)

The dataset is publicly available from multiple sources, including Kaggle and the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Application Overview:

This Preswald app provides an interactive visualization of the Iris dataset. The key features include:

Dynamic Filtering: Users can adjust the Petal Length Threshold using a slider to filter the dataset dynamically.

Tabular View: Displays the filtered dataset in a table.

Scatter Plot Visualization: Plots the Sepal Length vs. Sepal Width for different species using distinct colors.

Interactive UI: Users can explore how different threshold values affect the dataset visualization.
