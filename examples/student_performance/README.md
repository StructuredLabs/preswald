# Student Performance Analysis App

## Dataset Source

This app utilizes the [Student Performance Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/320/student+performance) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset was introduced in Cortez and Silva (2008) and contains student academic records, demographics, and school-related attributes for secondary education students in Portugal.

## Overview of the App

This interactive app provides insights into student performance based on various factors, including their urban or rural background and their aspiration to pursue higher education. The application allows users to:
- Filter students based on their final year grade (`G3`) using a slider.
- View an interactive table of urban students who meet the grade criteria.
- Visualize the distribution of final year grades (`G3`) based on students’ intentions to pursue higher education.
