```

---

## **Data Viewer**

Connect to a CSV file and display the data using Preswald's viewer:

```python
from preswald import connect, get_df, view

connect() # reads preswald.toml
data = get_df("example_data")
view(data)
```

---

## **Interactive Dashboard**

Create an interactive dashboard where users can control how many rows of data to display:

```python
from preswald import text, slider, view

text("# Interactive Dashboard")

rows = slider("Rows to Display", min_val=5, max_val=50, default=10)
view(data, limit=rows)
```

## **GraphQL Data Source**

Preswald supports connecting to GraphQL APIs, enabling you to load remote data into your dashboards. You can define the GraphQL query inline in your configuration file or load it from an external file.

### **Using an Inline Query**

Add the following to your `preswald.toml`:

```toml
[data.countries]
type = "graphql"
url = "https://countries.trevorblades.com/"
query = """
  query {
    countries {
      code
      name
      capital
    }
  }
"""
flatten = true
```

Then, use the following code to load and display the data:

```python
from preswald import connect, get_df, table, text

# Initialize connection (loads data sources as defined in preswald.toml)
connect()

# Load the GraphQL data source (using the 'countries' key from your config)
df = get_df("countries")

# Display a title and explanation about GraphQL integration
text(
    "# Countries Data\n\n"
    "This example demonstrates how GraphQL is implemented in Preswald. "
    "The query is defined inline in the preswald.toml file, fetching data from a public Countries API. "
    "The nested JSON response is automatically flattened into a simple DataFrame for display."
)

# Display the resulting data in a table
table(df, title="Countries")
```

### **Using an External Query File**

Alternatively, store your GraphQL query in an external file (e.g., `queries/get_countries.graphql`) with the following content:

```graphql
query {
  countries {
    code
    name
    capital
  }
}
```

Then, update your `preswald.toml` as follows:

```toml
[data.countries]
type = "graphql"
url = "https://countries.trevorblades.com/"
query_file = "queries/get_countries.graphql"
flatten = true
```

Use the same Python code as above to connect and display the data.
