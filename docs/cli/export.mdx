# `preswald export`

The `preswald export` command allows you to export your Preswald components and visualizations to different formats, including PDF.

## Arguments

- **`input_file` (str):**  
  Path to your component file that you want to export.
- **`output_file` (str):**  
  Destination path for the exported file.

## Options

- **`format` (str):**  
  The export format. Currently supports 'pdf'. Default is 'pdf'.
- **`output` (str):**  
  The output file path. Default is 'preswald_report.pdf'.

## Example Usage

Basic export to PDF:
```bash
preswald export --format pdf --output output.pdf hello.py
```

## Prerequisites

Before using the export functionality, ensure you have:

1. **Playwright Dependencies:**
```bash
pip install preswald[playwright]
playwright install
```

2. **Running Server:**
The export process requires a running Preswald server on port 8501. This can be started with `preswald run`.

## Detailed Explanation

### 1. **Server Requirements**

The export process requires:
- A running Preswald server on port 8501
- No firewall rules blocking access to port 8501
- No other applications using port 8501

### 2. **Component Requirements**

Your component should:
- Be properly formatted
- Render correctly in a browser
- Have all required data and dependencies accessible

### 3. **Troubleshooting**

Common issues and solutions:

#### Connection Refused Error
If you see `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED`:
- Ensure the Preswald server is running
- Check port 8501 is available
- Verify no firewall rules are blocking access

#### Missing Dependencies
For Playwright-related errors:
- Install the Playwright optional dependency
- Install browser dependencies using `playwright install`

### 4. **Best Practices**

- Always test component rendering in browser before export
- Start the Preswald server before running export
- Check server logs for troubleshooting
