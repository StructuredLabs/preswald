```python
chat(label: str, placeholder: str = "", size: float = 1.0) -> str
```

The `chat` function adds an interactive chat UI in which you can communicate with an AI chatbot about the data of your project.

## Parameters

- **`label`** _(str)_: The label displayed next to the text input, indicating its purpose. Also used to generate a consistent ID for state management.
- **`placeholder`** _(str)_: _(Optional)_ Placeholder text shown when the input is empty. Helps guide users on what to enter.
- **`size`** _(float)_: _(Optional)_ The width of the component in a row. Defaults to `1.0` (full row). See the [Layout Guide](/layout/guide) for details.

## Returns

- `str`: The current value of the text input. Empty string if no input has been provided.

## Usage Example

Here's an example of how to use chats in your app:

```toml
[data.openai]
api_key=YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY
```

```python
from preswald import chat

#Add chat component
chat("Explore your data", "Ask me anything")
```

### Key Features

1. **Explore Data Through Text**: Query and analyze the data from your data sources
2. **Customizable Label**: Set the label to distinguish between different `text_input`s.
3. **Adjustable Placeholder**: Control the look of the textboxes for better UI/UX.


### Why Use `chat`?

Chat provides an easy way to quickly explore your data, or for non technical users to explore data without knowing how to code.
