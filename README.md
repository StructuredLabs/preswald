Dynamic Filtering with Sliders: A slider allows users to filter data dynamically based on a minimum rating selection.
Data Visualizations:
Scatter Plot: Shows the relationship between Price and Rating across different categories.
Bar Chart: Displays the distribution of different categories in the dataset.
Box Plot: Analyzes the Price distribution per category.
Histogram: Shows the overall Rating distribution.
Summary
This app enables interactive data exploration using filters and visualizations to better understand trends and relationships within the dataset. ðŸš€
