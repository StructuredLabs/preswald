## Project Structure

**Preswald** uses a modern tech stack to deliver its functionality:

- **Backend**: Python with FastAPI.
- **Frontend**: React + Vite.

The project structure looks like this:

```
preswald/
â”œâ”€â”€ preswald/        # Core Python FastAPI backend
â”œâ”€â”€ frontend/       # React + Vite frontend application
â”œâ”€â”€ examples/       # Sample apps to showcase Preswald's capabilities
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/          # Unit and integration tests
â”œâ”€â”€ setup.py        # Python package configuration
â””â”€â”€ README.md       # Project overview
```

## Setup Guide

### 1. Fork and Clone the Repository

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/StructuredLabs/preswald.git
   cd preswald
   ```

### 2. Set Up a Python Environment

We recommend using Conda to manage dependencies:

1. Create and activate a Conda environment:
   ```bash
   conda create -n preswald python=3.11 -y
   conda activate preswald
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```
3. Set up pre-commit hooks:
   ```
   pre-commit install
   ```

### 3. Build the Frontend and Backend

1. Build the frontend assets:
   ```bash
   python setup.py build_frontend
   ```
2. Build the backend:
   ```bash
   python -m build
   ```

### 4. Run the Example App

Verify your setup by running the sample app:

```bash
preswald run examples/earthquakes.py
```

## Development Workflow

Hereâ€™s a quick summary of the contributing workflow:

1. **Fork and clone the repository.**
2. **Create a new branch** for your feature or bug fix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
3. **Make your changes** and follow the [Style Guide](#style-guide).
4. **Push your branch** to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
5. **Open a Pull Request** on the main repository.

## Style Guide

Follow these style guidelines to maintain consistency:

- **Python**: Use [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/).
- **React**: Follow [React Best Practices](https://react.dev/learn).
- **Formatting/Linting**:
  - Python: Use `black`, `isort`, and `ruff`.
    ```bash
    black .
    isort .
    ruff .
    ```
    These are set up in the pre-commit hook - will run upon `git commit` on staged files
  - JavaScript: Use ESLint with the provided configuration.
    ```bash
    npm run lint
    ```

## Pull Request Guidelines

When submitting a PR:

1. Use a descriptive branch name (e.g., `feature/add-widget` or `fix/typo-readme`).
2. Write a clear and concise PR title and description.
   - **Title**: Start with a type prefix, such as `feat`, `fix`, or `docs`.
   - **Description**: Include context, screenshots (if applicable), and links to relevant issues.
3. Ensure your PR includes:
   - Relevant tests for your changes.
   - Updates to the documentation if applicable.

Example PR description:

```
