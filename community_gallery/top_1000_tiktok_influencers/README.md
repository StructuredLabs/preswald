## Overview

**TikTok Influencer Analysis Dashboard** is an interactive data exploration tool built with [Preswald](https://github.com/StructuredLabs/preswald) and Plotly Express. This dashboard lets you filter and visualize key performance metricsâ€”such as subscribers, views, likes, comments, and sharesâ€”of TikTok influencers. Itâ€™s designed to provide engaging insights and help you discover which influencers are truly rocking the platform.

## Dataset Source

The dataset is a curated CSV file containing data on TikTok influencers, sourced from social media analytics platforms. It includes the following columns:

- **Tiktok name**
- **Subscribers** (formatted as "M" for millions and "K" for thousands)
- **Views avg**
- **Likes avg**
- **Comments avg**
- **Shares avg**

The data has been preprocessed to add numeric versions of key columns (e.g., `Subscribers_numeric`) for easier filtering and analysis.
