- Year-over-year release strategy comparison

## Data Visualization
- Interactive Plotly charts (line charts, bar charts, pie charts)
- Dynamic choropleth maps
- Correlation heatmaps
- Rating distribution visualizations
- Content addition heatmap
- Responsive design with adjustable visualization sizes

## How to Run

1. **Set Up Your Environment**
   ```bash
   # Install Preswald
   pip install .

   # Create a new project directory
   preswald init netflix_analysis
   cd netflix_analysis
   ```

2. **Configure Data Source**
   Create a `preswald.toml` file in your project directory with the following content:
   ```toml
   [data.netflix]
   path = "./data/netflix_titles.csv"
   ```

3. **Download the Dataset**
   Download the Netflix movies and TV shows dataset and save it as `netflix_titles.csv` in a `data` folder in your project directory.

4. **Run the App Locally**
   ```bash
   preswald deploy
   ```
   This will start a local development server, and you can access the dashboard at the URL shown in the terminal.

## Deployment
Run the following inside the project directory to deploy to Structured Cloud:
```bash
preswald deploy --target structured --github <your-github-username> --api-key <structured-api-key>
```
Replace `<your-github-username>` and `<structured-api-key>` with your credentials.
