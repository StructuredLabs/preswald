# **Preswald Project**

## **Dataset**
The dataset used in this project contains global water consumption data and is sourced from **Kaggle**. It provides comprehensive statistics on:
- Total Water Consumption (Billion Cubic Meters)  
- Per Capita Water Use (Liters per Day)  
- Water Scarcity Levels  
- Agricultural, Industrial, and Household Water Use (%)  
- Rainfall Impact and Groundwater Depletion  

The project visualizes this data through interactive charts and graphs, enabling users to gain insights into water consumption patterns and trends across different countries and years.
