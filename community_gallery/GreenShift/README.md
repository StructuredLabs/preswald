# GreenShift: Renewable Energy Adoption and Carbon Footprint Analysis

## Overview

GreenShift is a data visualization project that analyzes renewable energy adoption and carbon emissions trends across different countries. The project integrates datasets on renewable energy production and annual CO₂ emissions, presenting insights through interactive line charts and tables.

## Features

- **Interactive Line Graph**: Displays CO₂ emissions over time for selected countries, with an option to toggle additional countries dynamically.
- **Filtered Data Table**: Allows users to limit the number of displayed records while keeping all data accessible.
- **Preprocessed Datasets**: Merges renewable energy production and CO₂ emissions data, handling missing values efficiently.

## Datasets Used

- **Modern Renewable Energy Production Dataset**
- **Annual CO₂ Emissions Per Country Dataset**

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas** (Data preprocessing)
- **Plotly** (Interactive visualization)
- **Preswald** (Dashboard framework)
