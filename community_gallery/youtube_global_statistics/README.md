## **Features**
### **Global Filter - Slider for Views Threshold**
Before displaying the visualizations, the application features a **slider-based filter** that allows users to adjust the **minimum number of video views (in billions)** required for a category, creator, or country to appear in the plots. This enhances interactivity by dynamically filtering the dataset.

```python
views_threshold = slider("Minimum Views (Converted to Billion)", min_val=0, max_val=max_views, default=0.5)
```

Once a threshold is selected, **six different visualizations** are displayed.
