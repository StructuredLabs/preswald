# Preswald Project

## Setup
1. The dataset in /data has been truncated to the first 10 rows due to the large size of the full dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/miadul/brain-tumor-dataset/data)
2. My app aims to find a correlation between age and survival rate of brain tumors. It also classifies the cases by male/female.
3. This app can be run with `preswald run` in /brain_tumor_dataset folder. It might take a few seconds for visualizations to show up on localhost
