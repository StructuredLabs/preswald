# Traffic Crashes Data Analysis

This project visualizes traffic crash data by analyzing locations, crash types, and injury distribution. It uses interactive visualizations with **Preswald** to showcase the data insights.

The dataset used is a CSV file of traffic crashes that contains information about:
- `LATITUDE`: The latitude of the crash location.
- `LONGITUDE`: The longitude of the crash location.
- `CRASH_TYPE`: The type of crash (e.g., head-on, rear-end).
- `INJURIES_TOTAL`: The total number of injuries in the crash.

## Features
- **Interactive scatter plot**: Displays traffic crash locations on a map using latitude and longitude.
- **Crash injury distribution**: Bar chart of injury types across crashes.
- **Crash type distribution**: Pie chart of the distribution of crash types.
