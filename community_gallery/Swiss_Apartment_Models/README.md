This application provides an interactive way to explore and visualize architectural data from Swiss apartments, buildings, and floor plans. Built with Preswald, it allows users to navigate through a hierarchical structure of sites, buildings, floors, and apartments while visualizing their geometries.

## Features

- **Hierarchical Navigation**: Explore sites → buildings → floors → apartments
- **Interactive Visualization**: View floor plans and apartment layouts with color-coded elements
- **Data Exploration**: See entity distributions and sample data from the dataset
- **Toggle Controls**: Show/hide legends to manage visualization complexity

## Dataset

The application uses a comprehensive dataset of Swiss apartment geometries containing:

- **Areas**: Rooms, bathrooms, kitchens
- **Separators**: Walls, railings
- **Openings**: Windows, doors
- **Features**: Sinks, toilets, bathtubs, etc.

Each element includes spatial data in WKT format and hierarchical information about its location within the building.

[Download the dataset here](https://zenodo.org/records/7070952#.Y0mACy0RqO0)  and place it in the "data/ " folder of the current directory
