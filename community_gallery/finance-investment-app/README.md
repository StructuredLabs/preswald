   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   preswald run
   ```

### Deploying the App in Preswald
The app can be deployed in **Preswald Structured Cloud** using the following steps:

1. **Get an API Key**

   - Create a **New Organization** (top left corner)
   - Navigate to **Settings > API Keys**
   - Generate and copy your **Preswald API Key**

2. **Deploy Your App**
   Run the following command in your terminal, replacing `<your-github-username>` and `<structured-api-key>` with your actual credentials:
   ```bash
   preswald deploy --target structured --github <your-github-username> --api-key <structured-api-key> hello.py
   ```

3. **Verify the Deployment**
