# Electric Vehicle Data App:
  
## Data Source:
The data comes from the [Kaggle App](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yashdogra/ev-bhebic-c). 
It contains unsanitized data from the state of WA on local electric vehicles, their county, city, make, model, year, range and more.
While the data set has over 200K rows, I used a subset of just 9 rows for this project.
  
## Usage:
- The app filters the data for models that aren't Tesla's. Given the prevalence of Tesla's on the market and how fragmented the rest of the market is, I found this view interesting.
- The app filters for cars based on their range (in miles), giving you a unique view into which cars have longer lasting batteries; With the caveat that the data has discrepancies like one of the cars having a range of 0 miles.
- The app also gives you a look into which models by year, have the highest range. In future iterations, I would sanitize the data and discern between plug-ins and battery EVs.
  
## Running the App:
The production app is pending some trouble shooting with the team. However, locally you may run the app by installing Preswald, then running 'preswald run' from your command line.
Here's a quick [demo video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1exwL1adEfWTMJRWUwMeqPWj2KeqjZf1I/view?usp=drive_link).
