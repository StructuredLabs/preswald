Intro:
My app is a data visulization project on student_performance dataset. It explores the relationship between students' academic performance and attendance rate by using heatmap. The color of heatmap represents the count of students in the area. The x axis is attendance rate and the y axis their final scores. Additionally, it includes slider feature, allowing users to change the attendance rate to filter out students.

Data Source: 
The data is from kaggle, Student Performance & Behavior Dataset(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mahmoudelhemaly/students-grading-dataset/data)

Deployment: 
1. Configure your data connections in preswald.toml
2. Add sensitive information (passwords, API keys) to secrets.toml
3. Run your app with preswald run  to run locally
